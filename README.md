# Tanu-and-Head-bob
CodeChef Difficulty 1065 Problem

Tanu and Head-bob
Tanu has got interested in signs and gestures that we use for communication. One such gesture is the head-bob.

When we want to signal "Yes", we move the head up-and-down.

For "No", the head is moved left-and-right, rotating about the vertical axis.

There is a peculiar way of gesturing "Yes", commonly seen in India, by moving the head sideways (rotating about the forward-back axis). This is called the Indian head-bob.

Tanu observed many people at the railway station and made a list of gestures they made.

Each gesture is recorded as:

Y – Usual "Yes"

N – "No"

I – Indian "Yes" gesture

Your task is to identify which of them were Indians, which were not Indian, and which ones you cannot be sure about.

Input
First line contains an integer T, number of people observed.

For each person:

First line contains an integer N, the number of gestures recorded.

Second line contains a string of N characters. Each character is either 'Y', 'N', or 'I'.

Output
For each person, print:

"INDIAN" – if they made the Indian gesture

"NOT INDIAN" – if they made a "Yes" gesture but not the Indian one

"NOT SURE" – if they only made "No" gestures
